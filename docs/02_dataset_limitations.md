\# Dataset Limitations



The dataset contains structured subscription and customer support information but lacks direct behavioral or attitudinal indicators.



Key limitations include:



\- No engagement or usage metrics

\- No explicit customer satisfaction indicators

\- No recorded reasons for cancellation

\- Limited demographic depth

\- No longitudinal revenue tracking per customer



As a result, conclusions must be strictly constrained to observable variables. 



No assumptions will be made regarding customer satisfaction, perceived value, competitive positioning, or pricing fairness unless directly supported by available data.
