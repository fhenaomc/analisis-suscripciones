\# Dataset Limitations



This project focuses on identifying structural patterns associated with subscription cancellation using observable variables.



The dataset does not include:



Engagement metrics



Customer satisfaction indicators



Explicit cancellation reasons



Behavioral usage data



Therefore, conclusions are limited to observable subscription lifecycle and support interaction data.



No causal claims are made. Identified relationships are interpreted as associations unless otherwise supported by external evidence.
