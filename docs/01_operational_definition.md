\# Operational Definition of Churn



\## Business Context



The company operates a subscription-based digital financial advisory service offering newsletters, webinars, and investment recommendations. Customers subscribe to different plans and may contact customer support for assistance, upgrades, or cancellations.



From a business perspective, churn represents the loss of an active paying subscriber.



\## Analytical Definition



Given the available dataset, churn is operationally defined as:



\- A customer whose subscription status is marked as "Canceled", or  

\- A customer with no active product at the end of the observation period.



This definition does not incorporate behavioral engagement metrics (e.g., platform usage, content interaction), as such data is not available.



The analysis is therefore limited to structural subscription and case-level information.
