Analytical Definition



For this project, churn is operationally defined as:



A customer with a non-null cancel\_date\_time.



Customers with a null cancel\_date\_time are considered active at the end of the observation period.



This definition is strictly structural and does not incorporate engagement or behavioral signals, as such data is not available in the dataset.
