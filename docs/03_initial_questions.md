# Initial Analytical Questions

The exploratory phase of the project is guided by the following questions:

1. What is the overall churn rate within the dataset?

2. Does churn differ by product type or subscription plan?

3. Are there demographic patterns associated with higher churn?

4. Is there a relationship between customer support cases and churn?

5. Does subscription duration correlate with cancellation probability?

These questions aim to identify structural patterns rather than build predictive models.
