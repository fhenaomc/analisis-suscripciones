# Subscription Churn Analysis with Incomplete Data

This project focuses on analyzing subscriptions and customer churn under conditions of incomplete and indirect data, using a real-world–like subscription-based digital service.

---

## Company Context

The company offers a subscription-based digital financial advisory service, which includes newsletters, webinars, and investment recommendations.

Customers can subscribe to different plans (e.g., annual or digital subscriptions) and interact with a customer care team for support, sign-up, and cancellation requests.

---

## Problem Statement

The objective is to analyze customer churn using data that is not directly designed to explain churn behavior.

In most subscription-based businesses, acquiring a new customer is more costly than retaining an existing one. Failing to properly analyze churn-related signals can therefore pose a significant business risk, particularly when decisions are made based on incomplete or indirect information.

## Case Challenges

The available data includes:

- Basic customer information (e.g., customer ID, age, gender)
- Subscription lifecycle data (sign-up and cancellation dates, product type)
- Pricing and billing cycle information
- Customer interactions with the support team

However, the dataset does **not** include direct measures of customer satisfaction, perceived value, or explicit reasons for cancellation.

As a result, the analytical challenge lies in:

- Exploring potential signals associated with churn
- Evaluating which observable variables appear to be more closely related to subscription cancellation
- Explicitly acknowledging the limits of what can be inferred from the data

## Scope and Limitations

This project **does not aim** to:

- Build a unified high-risk churn user profile
- Develop a predictive churn model

Conclusions are strictly limited to what can be supported by the available data.

No claims are made regarding:
- Customer satisfaction
- Perceived value
- Pricing fairness
- Competitive positioning

Unless such claims can be reasonably inferred from observed variables or supported by external studies.

A more comprehensive churn analysis would require customer-facing surveys or qualitative research, which fall outside the scope of the current dataset.
